# nobodyplace

## Intro

After being an intern for six months in Tencent, I decided to actually accomplish something that benefits me in both real life and coding ability.
The reason I choose web application is the convenience for me to either use it or develop it.
I'm not saying that I'm familiar with VUE, JavaScript or etc., but the languages and structures are very easy to learn, and the website itself is frequently used.

So, nobodyplace is born.

## Features

1.0 ( WHEN? ) :
- Main Page is just like a normal search page, like classic Google with a big brand icon, and a simple input box for you to use search engine.
- Offers a calendar showing the exact dates that I drank coffee, did exercise or other custom records, as well as offering a trend chart.
- Since Typora is not free anymore, it's highly required to build an online blog with text format in markdown for myself. The online blog in nobodyplace can auto save your notes, upload images, create simple tables and even sorted by tag.

features in 2.0:
- Support dark mode and other backgrounds
- Settings
- CSGO with real-time price check
